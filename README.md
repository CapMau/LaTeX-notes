# LaTeX-cheatsheet
All the basic LaTeX how-tos in a single document. The information mainly comes from Overleaf's manuals.

Feel free to import the .tex file in your favourite editor and use it as a reference when writing your next LaTeX document! Made for beginners (like me), but suitable for anyone with a short memory and who can't be bothered googling every single thing.

Remember that for the .tex file to render properly, you will also need to download the images folder and place it in the same directory as the .tex file! Or you can just replicate the directory with another picture of your choosing.
