# LaTeX beginner notes
All the basic LaTeX how-tos in a single document. The information mainly comes from [Overleaf's Documentation](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Main_Page "Overleaf Documentation"). It's still a work in progress, so more will be added as I keep studying it!

Feel free to import the .tex file in your favourite editor and use it as a reference when writing your next LaTeX document! Made for beginners (like me), but suitable for anyone with a short memory and who can't be bothered googling every single thing. You can have a peek at the PDF here, but it is meant to be read along with the code.

Remember that for the document to compile properly, you will also need to download the test.bib file and the images folder, and place them in the same directory as the .tex file! Or you can just replicate them yourself. 

Note: compiling the document on your local editor might prompt the download of a few packages, especially if you're just starting out.
